The spread operator (...) introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) has multiple purposes and can be used in different contexts. Its main functionality is to "spread" or expand elements from iterable objects, such as arrays or strings, into individual elements.

1.Array and Object Destructuring:
->The spread operator can be used to destructure arrays or objects into separate variables.

2.Array Concatenation:
->The spread operator allows you to concatenate arrays easily by expanding the elements of multiple arrays into a new array.

3.Copying Arrays and Objects:
->The spread operator can create shallow copies of arrays or objects.

4.String to Array Conversion:
->The spread operator can convert a string into an array of individual characters.
