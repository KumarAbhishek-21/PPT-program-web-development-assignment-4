The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when trying to access a variable before it is declared, but within its scope. It is a concept that helps prevent accessing variables before they are initialized and promotes better coding practices.

In JavaScript, when a variable is declared using the let or const keywords, it is hoisted to the top of its scope like var variables. However, unlike var, variables declared with let and const are not accessible until they are fully initialized. Instead, they enter a "temporal dead zone" from the start of their scope until the point of declaration.
