Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), provide an enhanced way to work with strings in JavaScript. They allow you to include expressions and variables directly within a string, making string interpolation and multiline strings more convenient. Template literals are denoted by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

To use template literals, the following methods can be used:

1.Basic String Interpolation:
->You can insert expressions or variables within a template literal using the ${} syntax. The expression inside ${} will be evaluated and its result will be inserted into the string.

2.Multiline Strings:
->Template literals make it easier to create multiline strings without explicitly using newline characters. Line breaks within the template literal are preserved when the string is displayed.

3.Embedded Expressions:
->You can embed more complex JavaScript expressions or even function calls within ${} in template literals.

4.Escaping Backticks:
->If you need to include a backtick within a template literal, you can escape it using a backslash (\).
