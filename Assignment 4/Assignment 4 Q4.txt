1.Arrow Functions:

->Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions, with implicit this binding and simplified function syntax.

2.Block-Scoped Variables:

->The let and const keywords were introduced for declaring block-scoped variables, offering more predictable scoping behavior compared to var.

3.Template Literals:

->Template literals allow the creation of multi-line strings and string interpolation using backticks () instead of single or double quotes. They also support embedded expressions using ${}`.

4.Destructuring Assignment:

->Destructuring assignment provides an elegant way to extract values from arrays or objects into distinct variables, simplifying the process of working with complex data structures.

5.Default Parameters:

->Default function parameters allow developers to specify default values for function parameters, which are used when the arguments are not provided or are explicitly set as undefined.

6.Rest Parameters:

->Rest parameters allow functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, using the spread syntax (...), making it easier to work with variadic functions
